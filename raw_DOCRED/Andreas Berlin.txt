In the meantime he assisted Sir Joseph Banks and Banks 's assistant Daniel Solander , another of Linnaeus ' " apostles " . In 1773 Berlin travelled to Guinea with the English botanist Henry Smeathman . The purpose of the expedition , which was sponsored by members of the Royal Society , was to explore the central parts of West Africa but prior to reaching the mainland , Berlin died of a stomach illness while on the Îles de Los .
