Akkademja tal - Malti was the prime regulatory body responsible for the Maltese language from the early 20th century up to the end of the millennium , when a Government sponsored law was passed to protect issues related to the national language . On joining the European Union , Maltese became one of the recognised languages of the EU - no mean achievement for a language spoken by less than half a million people . Initially it was known as L - Għaqda tal - Kittieba tal - Malti ( Association of Writers of Maltese ) , Malta 's oldest literary society whose earliest activities go as far back as the early nineteen twenties , led by literary giants like Dun Karm , Ġużè Muscat Azzopardi and Ninu Cremona , it spearheaded the cause of the Maltese language . The Akkademja was mainly responsible for all the major linguistic and literary development of the Maltese language during the past century , developing linguistic academic initiatives which culminated in the national recognition of a standard written Maltese . In 2005 the National Council for the Maltese Language was set up through a Law by the Maltese Parliament . This Council is nowadays the main regulatory body of the Maltese language instead of the L - Akkademja tal - Malti .
