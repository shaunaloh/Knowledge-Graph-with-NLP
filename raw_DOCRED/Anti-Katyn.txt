Anti - Katyn ( , ) is a propaganda campaign intended to reduce the impact of the Katyn massacre of 1940 — when approximately 22,000 Polish citizens were murdered by the NKVD on the orders of Joseph Stalin — by referencing the deaths of thousands of Russian and Red Army soldiers at Polish internment camps from 1919 – 1924 . " Anti - Katyn " first emerged around 1990 . After the Soviet government admitted that it had previously tried to cover up its responsibility for the massacre by claiming that it was perpetrated by the Nazi German army , previously neglected research into the fate of Soviet POWs in Poland in 1920s was revived to be used as a " tit - for - tat " argument in the discussions of Katyn . Polish historian Andrzej Nowak summarized " Anti - Katyn " as an attempt by some Russian historians and publicists to " overshadow the memory of the crimes of the Soviet system against the Poles , creating imaginary analogies or even justification " because of the earlier deaths of the prisoners of war .
