" Annabel Lee " is the last complete poem composed by American author Edgar Allan Poe . Like many of Poe 's poems , it explores the theme of the death of a beautiful woman . The narrator , who fell in love with Annabel Lee when they were young , has a love for her so strong that even angels are envious . He retains his love for her even after her death . There has been debate over who , if anyone , was the inspiration for " Annabel Lee " . Though many women have been suggested , Poe 's wife Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe is one of the more credible candidates . Written in 1849 , it was not published until shortly after Poe 's death that same year .
