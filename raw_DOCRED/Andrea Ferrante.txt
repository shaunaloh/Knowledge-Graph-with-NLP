Andrea Ferrante ( born 16 August 1968 , Palermo , Italy ) is an Italian composer whose music is performed throughout Europe , Asia and the Americas and published by Videoradio and Rai Trade Labels , Edizioni Carrara and Edizioni Simeoli . His compositional activity , as shown in the essay Backstage of the creative act , the music psychologist Rosa Alba Gambino , can be divided into two phases : the first ( which ends with the composition of the holy La sposa del vento for soloists , chorus and orchestra staged in Palermo in 2000 by Operalaboratorio ) in which Andrea Ferrante investigates the Mediterranean sounds of his land through the filter of the contemporary , and the second ( after ten years of silence , and in collaboration with his favourite pianist Domenico Piccich√® ) in which the mature composer 's own language is inspired by multiculturalism and the concept of emotion / enjoyment of music that cast its production outside Europe . His compositional activity ranges from classical music to that for the image , even through recent collaborations in pop music with Giovanna Nocetti and Paolo Limiti ( poet and TV presenter ) which , exclusively for his music , wrote the lyrics to " The Man of no " . He teaches at the Conservatorio di Musica di Stato " Arcangelo Corelli " in Messina .
