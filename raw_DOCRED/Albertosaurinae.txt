Albertosaurines , or dinosaurs of the subfamily Albertosaurinae , lived in the Late Cretaceous of United States and Canada . The subfamily was first used by Philip J. Currie , JÃ¸rn H. Hurum and Karol Sabath as a group of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs . It was originally defined as " ( Albertosaurus + Gorgosaurus ) " , including only the two genera . The group is sister clade to Tyrannosaurinae . In 2007 , it was found that the group also contained Maleevosaurus , often synonymized with Tarbosaurus . However , this classification has not been accepted , and Maleevosaurus is still considered a juvenile Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus . Clevenger T. M. McLain found in an abstract , that Alioramus , commonly used as a derived tyrannosauroid , was an albertosaurine , or the sister taxon to the group .
