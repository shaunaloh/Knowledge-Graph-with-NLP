Anicia Juliana ( Constantinople , 462 â€“ 527/528 ) was a Roman imperial princess , the daughter of the Western Roman Emperor Olybrius , of the Anicii , by Placidia the younger daughter of Emperor Valentinian III and Licinia Eudoxia . She married Flavius Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus , and their children included Olybrius , consul for 491 . With her husband , she spent her life at the pre - Justinian court of Constantinople , of which she was considered " both the most aristocratic and the wealthiest inhabitant " . Her glittering genealogy aside , Juliana is primarily remembered as one of the first non - reigning female patrons of art in recorded history . From what little we know about her personal predilections , it appears that she " directly intervened in determining the content , as well , perhaps , as the style " of the works she commissioned . Her pro - Roman political views , as espoused in her letter to Pope Hormisdas ( preserved in the royal library of the Escorial ) are reflected in the chronicle of Marcellinus Comes , who has been associated with her literary circle . Whether Juliana entertained political ambitions of her own is uncertain , but it is known that her husband declined to take up the crown during the 512 riots . Although she resolutely opposed the Monophysite leanings of Emperor Anastasius , she permitted her son Olybrius to marry the Emperor 's niece .
