A Caribbean Mystery is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie , first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 16 November 1964 and in the United States by Dodd , Mead and Company the following year . The UK edition retailed at sixteen shillings ( 16/- ) and the US edition at $ 4.50 . It features the detective Miss Marple . Two reviewers at the time the novel was published said that Agatha Christie was returning to the top of her form . A critic writing in 1990 judged this plot to be standard fare for any writer who travels to the Caribbean and needs double duty out of a vacation . Two of the major characters reappear in the novel Nemesis , published in 1971 . Jason Rafiel reappears posthumously , and his assistant Esther Walters assists Miss Marple in the early chapters of the subsequent story .
