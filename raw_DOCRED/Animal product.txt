An animal product is any material derived from the body of an animal . Examples are fat , flesh , blood , milk , eggs , and lesser known products , such as isinglass and rennet . Animal by - products , as defined by the USDA , are products harvested or manufactured from livestock other than muscle meat . In the EU , animal by - products ( ABPs ) are defined somewhat more broadly , as materials from animals that people do not consume . Thus , chicken eggs for human consumption are considered by - products in the US but not France ; whereas eggs destined for animal feed are classified as animal by - products in both countries . This does not in itself reflect on the condition , safety , or " wholesomeness " of the product . Animal by - products are carcasses and parts of carcasses from slaughterhouses , animal shelters , zoos and veterinarians , and products of animal origin not intended for human consumption , including catering waste . These products may go through a process known as " rendering " to be made into human and non - human foodstuffs , fats , and other material that can be sold to make commercial products such as cosmetics , paint , cleaners , polishes , glue , soap and ink . The sale of animal by - products allows the meat industry to compete economically with industries selling sources of vegetable protein . Generally , products made from fossilized or decomposed animals , such as petroleum formed from the ancient remains of marine animals , are not considered animal products . Crops grown in soil fertilized with animal remains are rarely characterized as animal products . Several diets prohibit the inclusion of some animal products , including vegetarian , kosher , and halal . Other diets , such as veganism and the raw vegan diet , exclude any material of animal origin . In international trade legislation , the terminology products of animal origin ( POAO ) is used .
