André - Louis Debierne (; 14 July 1874 – 31 August 1949 ) was a French chemist and is considered the discoverer of the element actinium . Debierne studied at the elite École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris ( ESPCI ParisTech ) . He was a student of Charles Friedel , was a close friend of Pierre and Marie Curie and was associated with their work . In 1899 , he discovered the radioactive element actinium , as a result of continuing the work with pitchblende that the Curies had initiated . After the death of Pierre Curie in 1906 , Debierne helped Marie Curie carry on and worked with her in teaching and research . In 1910 , he and Marie Curie prepared radium in metallic form in visible amounts . They did not keep it metallic , however . Having demonstrated the metal 's existence as a matter of scientific curiosity , they reconverted it into compounds with which they might continue their researches .
