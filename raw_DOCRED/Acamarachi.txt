Acamarachi ( also known as Pili ) is a high volcano in northern Chile . In this part of Chile , it is the highest volcano . Its name means " black moon " . It is a volcano in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , a zone of strong volcanic activity during the last million years . Old volcanoes in the area are well - preserved , due to the dry climate . Acamarachi itself is a cone - shaped volcano with steep upper flanks and a lava dome on its northern side . While there is no indication of historical activity and the flank lava flows are old , some lava flows around the summit crater and a lava coulee north of Acamarachi on the saddle between Acamarachi and Colachi volcano may be postglacial in age . Acamarachi is formed by andesitic and dacitic rocks . Acamarachi features an Inca mountain sanctuary on which several figurines have been found . One female figurine is made out of silver , a male one is made out of thorny oyster . Both of these figurines were found with miniature clothing .
