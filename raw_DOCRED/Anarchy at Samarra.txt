The term " Anarchy at Samarra " refers to the period 861 â€“ 870 in the history of the Abbasid Caliphate , which was marked by extreme internal instability and the violent succession of four caliphs , who became puppets in the hands of powerful rival military groups . The term derives from the then capital and seat of the caliphal court , Samarra . The " anarchy " began in 861 , with the murder of Caliph al - Mutawakkil by his Turkish guards . His successor , al - Muntasir , ruled for six months before his death , possibly poisoned by the Turkish military chiefs . He was succeeded by al - Musta'in . Divisions within the Turkish military leadership enabled Musta'in to flee to Baghdad in 865 with the support of some Turkish chiefs ( Bugha the Younger and Wasif ) and the Tahirids , but the rest of the Turkish army chose a new caliph in the person of al - Mu'tazz and besieged Baghdad , forcing the city 's capitulation in 866 . Musta'in was exiled and executed . Mu'tazz was able and energetic , and tried to control the military chiefs and exclude the military from civil administration . His policies were resisted , and in July 869 he too was deposed and killed . His successor , al - Muhtadi , also tried to reaffirm the Caliph 's authority , but he too was killed in June 870 . With Muhtadi 's death and the ascension of al - Mu'tamid , the Turkish faction around Musa ibn Bugha , closely associated with Mu'tamid 's brother and regent al - Muwaffaq , became dominant in the caliphal court , ending the " anarchy " . Although the Abbasid Caliphate was able to stage a modest recovery in the following decades , the troubles of the " Anarchy at Samarra " inflicted great and lasting damage on the structures and prestige of the Abbasid central government , encouraging and facilitating secessionist and rebellious tendencies in the Caliphate 's provinces .
