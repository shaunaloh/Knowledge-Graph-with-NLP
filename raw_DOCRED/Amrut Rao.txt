Amrut Rao ( c. 1770 - 1824 ) was a Maratha noble , and the adopted son of Peshwa Raghunath Rao . In 1803 , Yashwant Rao Holkar invaded Pune and deposed his adoptive brother Peshwa Baji Rao II . Subsequently , Holkar set up an ad - hoc council nominally headed by Amrut Rao , and ran the Peshwa 's government in his name . Holkar also installed Amrut Rao 's son Vinayak Rao as the Peshwa to strengthen the legal status of his government , because Vinayak had been adopted by the widow of the deceased Peshwa Madhav Rao II . However , Baji Rao sought assistance from the British East India Company , whose advance forced Amrut Rao and his son to flee Pune . Subsequently , Amrut Rao signed a treaty with the British , agreeing to give up all claims over the Peshwa 's office in return for a pension and an estate in Bundelkhand .
