Anselperga was the eldest daughter of Desiderius , King of the Lombards , and Ansa . She was the second Abbess of San Salvatore e Santa Giulia , which her parents had formed in Brescia from the union of San Michele e San Pietro with San Salvatore e Santa Maria . Anselperga was richly endowed with land . She received donations from her father , mother , brother Adelchis , and her maternal relatives . During her tenure San Salvatore was removed by her father from the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Aquileia and given to the Archbishop of Milan . Nevertheless , on 13 October 772 , Anselperga received a privilege from Patriarch Sigwald . The date of Anselperga 's death is unrecorded , but she was replaced by Radoara as early as 781 .
