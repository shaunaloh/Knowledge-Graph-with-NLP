Abdul Qadeer Khan , (; ; born 1935 or 1936 ) , known as A. Q. Khan , is a Pakistani nuclear physicist and a metallurgical engineer , who founded the uranium enrichment program for Pakistan 's atomic bomb project . AQ Khan founded and established the Kahuta Research Laboratories ( KRL ) in 1976 , serving as both its senior scientist and Chairman until he retired in 2001 . Khan was also a figure in other Pakistani national science projects , making research contributions to molecular morphology , the physics of martensite alloys , condensed matter physics , and materials physics . In January 2004 , the Pakistani government summoned Khan for a debriefing on his active role in nuclear weapons technology proliferation in other countries after the United States provided evidence of it to the Pakistanis . Khan formally admitted his responsibility for these activities a month later . The Pakistani government dismisses allegations that Pakistani authorities sanctioned Khan 's activities . After years of official house arrest during and following his debriefing , the Islamabad High Court ( IHC ) on 6 February 2009 declared Abdul Qadeer Khan to be a free citizen of Pakistan , allowing him free movement inside the country . The verdict was rendered by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Aslam . In September 2009 , concerned because the decision also ended all security restrictions on Khan , the United States warned that Khan still remained a " serious proliferation risk " .
