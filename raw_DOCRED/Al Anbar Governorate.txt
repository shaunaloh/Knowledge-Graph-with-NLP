Al Anbar Governorate (; muḥāfaẓat al-’Anbār ) , or Anbar Province , is the largest governorate in Iraq by area . Encompassing much of the country 's western territory , it shares borders with Syria , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia . The provincial capital is Ramadi ; other important cities include Fallujah and Haditha . The governorate was known as Ramadi up to 1976 , when it was renamed Al Anbar Province , and it was known as Dulaim before 1962 . A large majority of the inhabitants of the province are Sunni Muslims and most belong to the Dulaim tribe , all of which speak Arabic . In early 2014 , the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , with the assistance of local Sunni militia , launched a successful campaign to seize control of the province from the Iraqi government . Numerous offensive actions were undertaken by the Iraqi government to remove ISIL 's occupation of the province – the Anbar campaign ( 2015 – 16 ) , the Western Anbar offensive ( September 2017 ) and the 2017 Western Iraq campaign . The area was effectively recaptured by the end of 2017 .
