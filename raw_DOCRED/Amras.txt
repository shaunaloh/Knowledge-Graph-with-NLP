In J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium , Amras ( ) is a fictional character , the twin brother of Amrod being the youngest sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel . Through their maternal grandfather Mahtan they inherited red hair ( probably a dark red ) , instead of Fëanor 's black . Amras ' father name in Quenya is Pityafinwë , " Little Finwë " . His mother name is Ambarussa , " Top - russet " , and this refers to his hair . His younger twin Amrod was also called Ambarussa , and they both answered to the name . In Tolkien 's late revisions , the name of the elder twin Ambarussa was " Amros " in Sindarin , instead of the older form " Amras " . The name of the younger twin , Amrod , was the Sindarin version of " Ambarto " . Amras became a hunter , who held the southern lands of the March of Maedhros . Amras survived most of the War of the Jewels , but eventually fell in the Kinslaying of Sirion .
