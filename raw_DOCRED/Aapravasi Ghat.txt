The Immigration Depot ( , Aapravasi Ghat ) is a building complex located in Port Louis on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius , the first British colony to receive indentured , or contracted , labour workforce from India . From 1849 to 1923 , half a million Indian indentured labourers passed through the Immigration Depot , to be transported to plantations throughout the British Empire . The large - scale migration of the laborers left an indelible mark on the societies of many former British colonies , with Indians constituting a substantial proportion of their national populations . In Mauritius alone , 68 percent of the current total population is of Indian ancestry . The Immigration Depot has thus become an important reference point in the history and cultural identity of Mauritius . Unchecked infrastructural development in the mid-20th century means that only the partial remains of three stone buildings from the entire complex have survived . These are now protected as a national monument , under the Mauritian national heritage legislation . The Immigration Depot 's role in social history was recognized by UNESCO when it was declared a World Heritage Site in 2006 . The site is under the management of the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund . Conservation efforts are underway to restore the fragile buildings back to their 1860s state .
