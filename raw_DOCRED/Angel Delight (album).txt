Angel Delight is the sixth album by the British folk - rock band Fairport Convention . This was the first Fairport Convention album without guitarist Richard Thompson , and the lineup consisted of Simon Nicol ( guitar , vocals ) ( the only original group member ) , Dave Swarbrick ( violin , vocals ) , Dave Pegg ( bass , vocals ) , and Dave Mattacks ( drums ) . The title derives from " The Angel " in Little Hadham , Hertfordshire , a former pub which the band were living in at the time , and the eponymous track is autobiographical , referring to " John the Wood " ( co - producer ) , " Dave the Drum " ( Mattacks ) , and even details such as " peer through the haze watching Top of the Pops " . The band moved out of The Angel shortly after the album 's release , partly because a lorry had run , out of control , into Dave Swarbrick 's bedroom . The U.K. album cover included liner notes consisting of dialogue among band members and roadies preparing to leave " The Angel " for a gig , that was replaced on American and Canadian copies by a more straightforward , biographical liner essay . Musically , Angel Delight progressed little from its predecessors , although an appearance on Top of the Pops as a featured album contributed to its chart success ; it reached number eight on the UK Album chart , making it the band 's highest charting album in the UK .
