Adandozan was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey , in present - day Benin , from 1797 until 1818 . His rule ended with a coup by his brother Ghezo who then erased Adandozan from the official history resulting in high uncertainty about many aspects of his life . Adandozan took over from his father Agonglo in 1797 but was quite young at the time and so there was a regent in charge of the kingdom until 1804 . Dealing with the economic depression that had defined the administrations of his father Agonglo and grandfather Kpengla , Adandozan tried to increase slave raiding , increase European trade , and when these failed reform the economy to focus on agriculture . Unfortunately , these efforts did not end domestic dissent and in 1818 at the Annual Customs of Dahomey , Ghezo and Francisco Félix de Sousa , a powerful Brazilian slave trader , organized a coup d'état and replaced Adandozan . He was left alive and lived until the 1860s hidden in the palaces while he was largely erased from official royal history .
