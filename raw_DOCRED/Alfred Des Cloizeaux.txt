He studied the geysers of Iceland , and wrote also on the classification of some of the eruptive rocks . His main work consisted in the systematic examination of the crystals of numerous minerals , in researches on their optical properties and on the subject of light polarization . He demonstrated the circular polarization of cinnabar . He wrote especially on the means of determining the different feldspars , and is credited with the discovery of microcline ( a triclinic potash - feldspar ) . He named the minerals montebrasite ( 1871 ) , binnite ( a variety of tennantite ) and Christianite ( in honor of Christian VIII of Denmark ) .
