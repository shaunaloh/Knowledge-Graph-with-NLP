Adolph Albrecht Erlenmeyer ( 11 July 1822 – 9 August 1877 ) was a German physician and psychiatrist born in Wiesbaden . He studied medicine in Marburg , Bonn and Berlin . At the University of Bonn he studied under surgeon Karl Wilhelm Wutzer ( 1789 – 1863 ) , and after receiving his doctorate from the University of Berlin , he was an assistant to psychiatrist Carl Wigand Maximilian Jacobi ( 1777 – 1858 ) at the asylum in Siegburg . As a young man , Erlenmeyer was influenced by Jacobi 's somatic approach to psychiatry , and felt that there needed to be a close unity of psychiatry and neurology . In 1848 he opened a private asylum in Bendorf bei Koblenz that was to become known as Asyl für Gehirn- und Nervenkranke . During the ensuing years the facility expanded , eventually having a department of neurology ( 1866 ) and an " agricultural colony " called Albrechtshöhe ( 1867 ) . In 1854 Erlenmeyer became a co - founder of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie und gerichtliche Psychologie ( German Society for Psychiatry and Forensic Psychology ) . His son , psychiatrist Friedrich Albrecht Erlenmeyer ( 1849 – 1926 ) is remembered for his research of morphine addiction .
