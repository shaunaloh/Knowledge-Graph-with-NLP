The domain name mil is the sponsored top - level domain ( sTLD ) in the Domain Name System of the Internet for the United States Department of Defense and its subsidiary or affiliated organizations . The name is derived from military . It was one of the first top - level domains , created in January 1985 . The United States is the only country that has a top - level domain for its military , a legacy of the United States ' military role in the creation of the Internet . Other countries often use second - level domains for this purpose , e.g. , mod.uk for the United Kingdom 's Ministry of Defence . Canada uses norad.mil with the United States as they jointly operate the North American Aerospace Defense Command . Despite having a dedicated top - level domain , the US military also uses com domains for some of its recruitment sites , such as goarmy.com , as well as for the Defense Commissary Agency 's website www.commissaries.com and most non - appropriated fund instrumentalities such as military MWR organizations and military exchanges . Also , the military uses edu domains for its service academies : the United States Military Academy , United States Coast Guard Academy , United States Naval Academy , and the United States Air Force Academy can all be reached using either an edu or a mil domain name . The official athletic program sites of the three academies that are members of NCAA Division I ( Army , Navy , Air Force ) use com domains , as well as Coast Guard , which is a member of NCAA Division III . The Department of Defense itself uses gov for its home page , with at least three second - level domains within mil ( defense , dod , and pentagon ) redirecting to its domain name www.defense.gov . The United States Coast Guard , like other military services , uses the mil domain , although during statutory peacetime the service falls under the United States Department of Homeland Security .
