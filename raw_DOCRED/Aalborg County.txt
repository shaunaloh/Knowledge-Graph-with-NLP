Aalborg County ( ) is a former province in Denmark , located in north - eastern Jutland around the eastern approach to the Limfjord . Aalborg County was established in 1793 and abolished in 1970 when it merged with Hjørring County forming the new North Jutland County . The region belonged to Himmersyssel during the Middle Ages , with the exception of Kær Herred - located north of the Limfjord - which belonged to Vendsyssel . In 1542 , the north Jutland region was reorganised as Aalborghus Len . This province was divided in 1662 forming Aalborghus County and Aastrup , Sejlstrup and Børglum County . The latter province was divided again in 1793 with the bulk of its territory being reorganized as Hjørring County . Smaller parts of the province became parts of the counties of Thisted and Aalborg . This division lasted from 1793 to 1970 when the two counties merged , forming the new North Jutland County . Aalborg County featured the market towns ( købstæder ) of Aalborg , Løgstør , Nibe , and Nørresundby .
