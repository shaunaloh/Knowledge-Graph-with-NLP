The Anthony Power Development Scheme , part of the Pieman River power development scheme , was a proposed scheme for damming parts of the upper catchment of the Pieman River in Western Tasmania , Australia . Proposed by the Hydro - Electric Commission of Tasmania , approved by the Tasmanian Government in 1983 , and environmental management established in 1984 , the scheme proposed the development of five dams across various rivers that drain the West Coast Range towards the Southern Ocean . However , as a result of political and legal opinion that , most notably , saw the overturning of the proposed Franklin Dam in South West Tasmania , only one of the dams proceeded , the Anthony Dam and adjacent Anthony Levee , both across the Anthony River that formed Lake Plimsoll and enabled the creation of the Tribute Power Station .
