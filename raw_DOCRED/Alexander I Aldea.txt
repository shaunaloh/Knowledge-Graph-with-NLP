Alexander I Aldea ( 1397 – 1436 ) was a Voivode of Wallachia ( 1431–1436 ) from the House of Basarab , son of Mircea the Elder . He came to rule Wallachia during an extremely turbulent time when rule of the country changed hands by violence eighteen times during the 15th century . Alexander I took the throne by ousting Dan II of Wallachia , father to Basarab II . Dan II was on his 5th rule of Wallachia , having gone back and forth with Radu II several times over the course of seven years during the 1420s . He was strong enough to hold the throne for what was then a considerable time , a stretch of five years . However , in the winter of 1436 he died , most probably from illness , as there are no rumours to the contrary . Upon his death , his half - brother Vlad II Dracul assumed the throne and would hold it off and on until he was killed in 1447 . Alexander I was the uncle of Vlad Tepes ( son of Vlad II Dracul ) , the inspiration for the Bram Stoker 's novel Dracula .
