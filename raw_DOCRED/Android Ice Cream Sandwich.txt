Android   4.0–4.0.4 " Ice Cream Sandwich " is the ninth version of the Android mobile operating system developed by Google . Unveiled on October 19 , 2011 , Android   4.0 builds upon the significant changes made by the tablet - only release Android Honeycomb , in an effort to create a unified platform for both smartphones and tablets . Android   4.0 was focused on simplifying and modernizing the overall Android experience around a new set of human interface guidelines . As part of these efforts , it introduced a new visual appearance codenamed " Holo " , which is built around a cleaner , minimalist design , and a new default typeface named Roboto . It also introduced a number of other new features , including a refreshed home screen , near - field communication ( NFC ) support and the ability to " beam " content to another user using the technology , an updated web browser , a new contacts manager with social network integration , the ability to access the camera and control music playback from the lock screen , visual voicemail support , face recognition for device unlocking ( " Face Unlock " ) , the ability to monitor and limit mobile data usage , and other internal improvements . Android   4.0 received positive reviews by critics , who praised the cleaner , revamped appearance of the operating system in comparison to previous versions , along with its improved performance and functionality . However , critics still felt that some of Android   4.0 's stock apps were still lacking in quality and functionality in comparison to third - party equivalents , and regarded some of the operating system 's new features , particularly the " face unlock " feature , as being gimmicks . , statistics issued by Google indicate that 0.3 % of all Android devices accessing Google Play run Ice Cream Sandwich .
