The Adelaide Rams were an Australian professional rugby league football club based in Adelaide , South Australia . The team was formed in 1995 for the planned rebel Super League competition , which eventually ran parallel to the rival Australian Rugby League ( ARL ) competition in 1997 . The Rams lasted two seasons , the first in the Super League competition in 1997 and the second in the first season of the National Rugby League ( NRL ) in 1998 . The Rams were not a successful club , winning only 13 out of 42 games . However crowd numbers in the first season were the fifth highest of any first - grade club that year , but dwindled to sixteenth in the second season . The Adelaide club was shut down at the end of the 1998 season as a result of poor on - field performances , dwindling crowd numbers , financial losses and a reduction in the number of teams in the NRL . They remain the only team from the state of South Australia to have participated in top - level rugby league in Australia .
