The Academia Mexicana de la Lengua ( variously translated as the Mexican Academy of Language , the Mexican Academy of the Language , the Mexican Academy of Letters , or glossed as the Mexican Academy of the Spanish Language ; acronym AML ) is the correspondent academy in Mexico of the Royal Spanish Academy . It was founded in Mexico City on 11 September 1875 and , like the other academies , has the principal function of working to ensure the purity of the Spanish language . Academy members have included many of the leading figures in Mexican letters , including philologists , grammarians , philosophers , novelists , poets , historians and humanists . The Academia Mexicana organized the first Congress of the Spanish Language Academies that was celebrated at Mexico City in April 1951 . This gave birth , through its Permanent Commission , to the Association of Spanish Language Academies , confirmed in the second Congress , celebrated in Madrid five years later .
