In Greek mythology , Agamemnon (; , Ἀgamémnōn ) was a king of Mycenae , the son of King Atreus and Queen Aerope of Mycenae , the brother of Menelaus , the husband of Clytemnestra and the father of Iphigenia , Electra or Laodike ( Λαοδίκη ) , Orestes and Chrysothemis . Legends make him the king of Mycenae or Argos , thought to be different names for the same area . When Helen , the wife of Menelaus , was taken to Troy by Paris , Agamemnon commanded the united Greek armed forces in the ensuing Trojan War . Upon Agamemnon 's return from Troy , he was killed ( according to the oldest surviving account , Odyssey 11.409 – 11 ) by Aegisthus , the lover of his wife Clytemnestra . In old versions of the story , the scene of the murder , when it is specified , is usually the house of Aegisthus , who has not taken up residence in Agamemnon 's palace , and it involves an ambush and the deaths of Agamemnon 's followers as well . In some later versions , Clytemnestra herself does the killing , or they act together as accomplices , killing Agamemnon in his own home .
