Amanieu VIII ( sometimes VII ) ( died 1326 ) was the Lord of Albret from 1298 until his death ; the son of Amanieu VII . He was an ally of the English and sat on the King 's Council during the reigns of Edward I and Edward II of England . As a relative of the Plantagenets and of the sitting pope ( Martin IV ) and one of the most powerful lords in Gascony , he was the recipient of conspicuous royal largesse . In 1286 Amanieu ended a long private war with Jean Ferrars , the English seneschal of Gascony , in return for 20,000 livres tournois from Edward I. His son Bernard Ezi IV succeeded him in Albret and on the Council . Amanieu used the French occupation of Aquitaine during the war between Edward I and Philip IV of France from 1294 to 1303 to expand his own authority at the expense of the ducal administration . Between 1310 and 1324 he continued to increase his independence from the English government in Bordeaux by appealing a successive number of sometimes trivial quarrels before the Parlement of Paris . In 1324 he completed his defection from the English cause by joining the French during the short War of Saint - Sardos
