Mustansiriyah University ( Arabic : الجامعة المستنصرية ) is a university in Baghdad , Iraq . The original Mustansiriya Madrasah , was established in 1227 ( or 1232/34 A.D. by some accounts ) by the Abbasid Caliph Al - Mustansir and was one of the oldest universities in the world . Its building , on the left bank of the Tigris River , survived the Mongol invasion of 1258 and has been restored . The modern Mustansiriyah University was established with the help and financial support of the Republic of Ίrāq Teacher ’s Union in 1963 , mainly providing evening courses . In 1964 , the University was given the status of a semi - state institution and some state financial support . At the same time it absorbed Al - Sha’ab University , another private university that had been founded by the Ίrāqi Association of Economists , and then moved to a new campus to the north of the city centre . Initially , the University also managed colleges in Mosul and Basra . In 1966 a law was passed under which the private universities were converted into public universities . Mustansiriyah thus became , briefly , a College within the University of Baghdad . In 1967 a major reorganisation of higher education was initiated , with the intention that by 1969 all previous institutions would be abolished and reconstituted . Mustansiriyah was designated as a separate University in 1968 , and its branch campuses were detached to form part of the University of Mosul and the University of Basra .
