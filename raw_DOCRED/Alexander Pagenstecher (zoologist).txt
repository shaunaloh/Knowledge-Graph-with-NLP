Heinrich Alexander Pagenstecher ( 18 March 1825 , Elberfeld – 4 January 1889 , Hamburg ) was a German zoologist . He studied medicine at the universities of Göttingen , Heidelberg and Berlin and furthered his education in Paris . Following graduation , he worked as a general practitioner in his hometown of Elberfeld ( 1847 ) , as a spa doctor in Salzbrunn ( 1848 – 49 ) and as a physician in Barmen ( 1849 ) . In 1856 he obtained his habilitation for obstetrics at the University of Heidelberg . Because of a serious injury to two of his fingers , he considered himself unfit for surgery and obstetrics , and subsequently shifted his attention from medicine to zoology . In 1863 he was named an associate professor of zoology and paleontology as well as director of the zoological institute at Heidelberg , where in 1866 , he attained a full professorship . In 1882 he was appointed director of the Natural History Museum in Hamburg . The herpetological species Pseudomoia pagenstecheri ( Southern grass tussock skink ) is named in his honor .
