A Christmas to Remember is a 1999 Christmas album by Amy Grant with the Patrick Williams Orchestra , which became certified gold . It is her third Christmas album with a blend of some traditional songs but mostly originals . In 2007 , A Christmas to Remember was reissued and digitally remastered by Grant 's new record label , EMI / Sparrow Records , along with 13 other Amy Grant albums . The remastered edition is labeled with a " Digitally Remastered " logo in the ' gutter ' on the CD front . Because of Grant 's deal with her previous label , Word Records , the remastered editions of A Christmas to Remember and Behind the Eyes was not sold in Christian Music retailers such as Family Christian Stores or Lifeway Christian Resources until 2009 . Until 2009 , Word Records continued to distribute those titles to Christian retailers in the original , non - remastered editions while EMI distributed the remastered editions to most major retailers . The twelve remaining remastered editions were distributed by EMI to all US retailers , both Christian and secular . An early release of the CD was sold exclusively at Target Stores and featured a cover of The Carpenters song " Merry Christmas Darling " as a hidden track . This track was eventually re - released on Amy Grants ' 2005 compilation Christmas album My Best Christmas .
