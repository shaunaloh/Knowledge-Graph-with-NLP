Ampato ( possibly from Quechua hamp'atu or from Aymara jamp'atu , both meaning " frog " ) is a dormant stratovolcano in the Andes of southern Peru . It lies about northwest of Arequipa and is part of a north - south chain that includes the volcanoes Hualca Hualca and Sabancaya , the last of which has been active in historical time . Ampato consists of three volcanic cones , which lie on top of an older eroded volcanic edifice . They were formed sequentially by extrusion of lava flows , but Ampato has also had explosive eruptions which have deposited ash , lapilli and pumice in the surrounding landscape . One young lava flow has been dated to 17,000 Â± 6,000 years before present , but a summit lava dome is even younger , and Holocene ash layers in surrounding peat bogs may testify to the occurrence of recent eruptions . The present - day volcano is covered by an ice cap , and during the last glacial maximum glaciers advanced to low altitudes . In 1995 , an Inca mummy known as Mummy Juanita was discovered on Ampato by Johan Reinhard ; it had been offered as a human sacrifice more than six hundred years earlier on the mountain .
