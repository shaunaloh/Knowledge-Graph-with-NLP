The Aarhus Theatre ( Danish : Aarhus Teater ) in Aarhus , is the largest provincial theatre in Denmark . The present theatre house was constructed in the late 19th century , as a replacement for the old theatre , nicknamed " Svedekassen " ( The Sweat - box ) . Since Aarhus had grown to become Jutland 's biggest city during the 19th century , the old theatre had become too small to serve the public demand . A new building was designed by the Danish architect Hack Kampmann ( 1856 â€“ 1920 ) , and the construction began on 12 August 1898 . Only two years later , Aarhus Theatre stood completed and was inaugurated on 15 September 1900 . The architectural style of the building is Art Nouveau , with the national romantic emphasis on natural materials , and the interior design was completed by artists Hansen Reistrup and Hans Tegner . In 2007 , the Aarhus Theatre received an audio make - over .
