Alexander Markey ( 1891 – 1958 ) was an American filmmaker and founder of Markey Films ( president Harry J. Thomas ) . He was born in Hungary and died in Switzerland . From 1928 to 1935 he was in New Zealand making films about the Māori people . In 1928 he was sent by Carle Laemmle of Universal Studios to make a film he called Taranga , but did not keep to schedule or make any effective footage . So the film was made as Under the Southern Cross by Lew Collins . Two years later and described as " somewhat eccentric " Markey then returned for the making of Hei Tiki ; originally a silent film , which was released in 1935 with music and voice - over added in America . The film was shot in Waihi . When shooting was finished Markey left for America with “ the film footage , many of the artifacts he had borrowed from Māori , a great many unpaid bills , and his partner Zoe Varney ” . He had obtained £ 10,000 from New Zealand investors , and borrowed taonga or cherished tribal artifacts from the Māori cast . He had fired Alfred Hill who was to write the music , and Ted Coubray the original cameraman , but sold Coubray ’s camera to his rivals the Welsh brothers . A 1935 New York Times review of Hei Tiki says that Merkey had been a lecturer and editor .
