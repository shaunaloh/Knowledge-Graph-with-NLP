Anachlysictis gracilis is an extinct carnivorous mammal belonging to the group Sparassodonta , which were metatherians ( a group including marsupials and their close relatives ) that inhabited South America during the Cenozoic . Unlike other remains assigned to the family Thylacosmilidae ( a group of metatherian predators equipped with " saber teeth " ) that had been found previously , Anachlysictis is the first record of such borhyaenoids in northern South America , and also most primitive and ancient in the family ( in fact , is the first confirmed record that did not belong to the genus Thylacosmilus , until the official publication of Patagosmilus in 2010 ) . This species was found in the Villavieja Formation in the area of La Venta in Colombia , a famous fossil deposit in the Middle Miocene ( Laventan ; 13.8 - 11.8 million years ago ) , based on fragments that include a front portion of the lower jaw , with an incipient molar tooth and a piece of carnassial from the front of the maxilla .
