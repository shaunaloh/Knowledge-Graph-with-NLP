An Anzac biscuit is a sweet biscuit , popular in Australia and New Zealand , made using rolled oats , flour , sugar , butter ( or margarine ) , golden syrup , baking soda , boiling water , and ( optionally ) desiccated coconut . Anzac biscuits have long been associated with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) established in World War I. The biscuits were sent by wives and women 's groups to soldiers abroad because the ingredients do not spoil easily and the biscuits kept well during naval transportation . Today , Anzac biscuits are manufactured commercially for retail sale . Anzac biscuits should not be confused with hardtack , which was nicknamed " ANZAC wafers " in Australia and New Zealand .
