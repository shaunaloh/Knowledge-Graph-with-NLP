Alfred John Kennett Todd ( 13 April 1890 â€“ 27 August 1970 ) was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom . He was elected at the 1929 general election as Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Berwick - upon - Tweed . In May 1935 , Todd resigned the whip of the National Government , along with Frederick Wolfe Astbury , Joseph Nall , Linton Thorp and Katharine Stewart - Murray , Duchess of Atholl , as they claimed that some aspects of government policy were too close to socialism , and were unhappy with government policy on India . However , Todd continued to identify with the Conservative Party , and took the whip again in September , to show support for the Government during the Abyssinia Crisis . Todd lost his seat in a narrow defeat at the 1935 general election by the Liberal candidate Sir Hugh Seely . He did not stand for Parliament again . His grandson Mark Todd is a Labour Party politician , elected in 1997 as MP for South Derbyshire .
