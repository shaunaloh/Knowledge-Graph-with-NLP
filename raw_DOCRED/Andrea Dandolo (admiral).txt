Andrea Dandolo ( died September 1298 ) , noble of Venice , was the commander of the Venetian fleet that confronted the Genoan fleet in the Battle of Curzola ( 8 September 1298 ) , which ended in disaster for the Venetians . During this battle Marco Polo , in command of one of the ninety - eight Venetian galleys , was captured - it was during this imprisonment that he began to write his Travels . Andrea was also captured by the Genoese ; contemporary historians report that " Andrea Dandolo , being unable to bear the disgrace of such defeat , beating his head against the wooden hull of the galley taking him to prison , killed himself " , depriving the Genoese of the satisfaction of executing him .
