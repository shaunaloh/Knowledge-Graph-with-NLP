Actus Tragicus , sometimes credited as Actus Comics or simply Actus , is a group of five Israeli comics artists founded in 1995 by Rutu Modan and Yirmi Pinkus . Other members include Batia Kolton , Itzik Rennert and Mira Friedmann . Actus Tragicus was founded to enable its members , all professional illustrators and comics artists , to reach an audience outside of Israel by publishing a book each year , free of any cultural limitations or economic hindrances . Their books appear around the time of the Angoulême International Comics Festival in France where they receive their first public exposure . The group has won international acclaim and was described in 2007 by the ID design magazine as one of the most prominent contemporary design groups . Well known international comics artists such as Anke Feuchtenberger and Henning Wagenbreth ( Germany ) , Stéphane Blanquet ( France ) and David Polonsky ( Israel ) participated in the Actus Tragicus projects . Actus Tragicus have published nine books and numerous series so far , as well as a special comics album , Dead Herring Comics , which featured an excerpt from Art Spiegelman 's In the Shadow of No Towers .
