Ali - Reza Asgari ( , born 1 November 1952 ) was an Iranian general of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps , deputy defense minister , and cabinet member of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami . Asgari had been " pushed aside " from his ministerial role after President Ahmadinejad , a former rival , came into power in 2005 . Asgari disappeared in Turkey in early 2007 , and news reports indicate that he either defected or was kidnapped by Western intelligence agencies . His disappearance has also led to reports that Iran would retaliate by kidnapping American or Israeli officials in Europe . According to The Sunday Times , Asgari was described as a " gold mine for western intelligence " by an Israeli defence source who claimed that they had been following him since the 1980s .
