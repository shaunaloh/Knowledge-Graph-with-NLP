" ( We 've Got ) Honey Love " is a 1967 song by Motown girl group The Velvelettes that later became a 1969 single released by another Motown girl group Martha and the Vandellas from their album " Ridin ' High " released in 1968 . The song returned the Vandellas to the top forty of Billboard 's R&B ; singles chart where it peaked at number twenty - seven while it hit the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at number fifty - seven . It was the group 's sixth record where they were listed as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas following the successful " Honey Chile " single two years earlier . The song talked of how one woman 's lover 's charm was like " sugar and spice " adding names of candy and soda adding " a little bit of me , a little bit of you and we 've got honey love . " The Velvelettes , meanwhile , had recorded two versions of the song ( one led by the group 's lead singer , Carolyn ' Cal ' Gill , the other is a rear lead for then group member - and future Vandella - Sandra Tilley ) , both of which would go unreleased for almost 40 years . All three versions were written by Richard Morris and Sylvia Moy , and produced by Morris ( with Moy co - producing the version by The Velvelettes ) .
