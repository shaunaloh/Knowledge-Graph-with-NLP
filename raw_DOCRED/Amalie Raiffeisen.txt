Amalie Raiffeisen ( 2 August 1846 - 11 January 1897 ) was a German social reformer . By the 1860s her father , Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen , was almost blind . By handling his correspondence with him she was indispensable in his creation of the Cooperative movement in Germany . She grew up in a religious family and was educated according to the social precepts of the time , accepting that even after reaching adulthood it was her duty to respect her father 's wishes . These involved shunning marriage in order to stay by her father 's side and help him in his work . After Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen eventually died , in 1888 , she continued to work for the Cooperative movement . From 1892 till her own death she was the only surviving family member with shares in the undertaking .
