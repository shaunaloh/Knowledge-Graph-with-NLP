Angola – Democratic Republic of the Congo relations refers to the current relationship between Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Historically , Angola has been closely involved in Congolese politics , taking part in the 1997 war to oust Mobutu Sese Seko from power . It then intervened during the Second Congo War in 1998 on the side of the new administration under Laurent - Désiré Kabila . Since the end of the conflict , the Angolan government remained an ally of President Joseph Kabila and supported him militarily . However , Angola 's main interest is stability in the DRC , and Kabila 's attempts to remain in power and postponement of elections since the end of his term in December 2016 , leading to mass protests , have caused a cooling in relations between the two countries . About 30,000 Congolese refugees fleeing from violence in the Kasaï - Central region of the DRC due to the Kamwina Nsapu rebellion that began in August 2016 entered Angola . By late 2017 , several thousand returned to Congo . In October 2018 , about 300,000 Congolese fled Angola , many of them in response to violence in the mining town Lucapa ; DRC 's foreign minister Léonard She Okitundu summoned Angola ’s ambassador over the expulsion , demanding a “ comprehensive investigation to establish who is responsible for these wrongful acts ” .
