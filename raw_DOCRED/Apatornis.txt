Apatornis is a genus of prehistoric birds endemic to North America during the late Cretaceous . It currently contains a single species , Apatornis celer , which lived around the Santonian - Campanian boundary , dated to about 83.5 million years ago . The remains of this species were found in the Smoky Hill Chalk of the Niobrara Formation in Kansas , United States . It is known from a single fossil specimen : a synsacrum , the fused series of vertebrae over the hips . While the known fossil remains are very incomplete , enough has been found to reasonably estimate that the body length of this bird was between . The type specimen of A. celer , YPM 1451 , was reportedly discovered by Othniel Charles Marsh in October 1872 at Butte Creek in Logan County , Kansas . This location is now recognized as falling between Marker Units 15 and 19 of the Smoky Hill Chalk geological formation . An additional , more complete specimen had also been referred to Apatornis celer by Marsh . This more complete specimen had historically been the one used almost exclusively to form the basis of what was known about Apatornis . However , Julia Clarke noted in 2004 that because the second specimen did not preserve any of the same bones as the first , the two could not be scientifically compared . Clarke therefore reclassified the second specimen as its own genus and species , Iaceornis marshi .
