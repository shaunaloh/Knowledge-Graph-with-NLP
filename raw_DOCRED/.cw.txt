.cw is the Internet country code top - level domain ( ccTLD ) for Curaçao . It was created following the decision on December 15 , 2010 by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency to allocate CW as the ISO 3166 - 1 alpha-2 code for Curaçao . This decision followed Curaçao 's new status as an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands on October 10 , 2010 . The University of Curaçao , which already was the sponsor for .an was designated as the sponsoring organization . Registration of .cw domains is available from 1 February 2012 . Currently , many websites in Curaçao still use the former Netherlands Antilles 's ccTLD , .an . Domains from .an will be able to switch to .sx ( Sint Maarten ) or .cw , depending on where they are based .
