The Adäka Cultural Festival ( ' Adäka ' or ' Festival ' ) is an annual multi - disciplinary arts and culture festival in Whitehorse , Yukon that celebrates First Nations arts and culture , with a specific focus on Yukon First Nations . ' Adäka ' , in the Southern Tutchone language , means ' coming into the light ' which reflects the Yukon First Nations arts and culture being brought forward to the public eye and celebrated by all . The Festival name was inspired by the work of Joe Johnson , the late father of Festival co - founder , Katie Johnson . Several years prior to the launch of Adäka , Joe had been involved in a conference of the same name . That conference brought the people of the Yukon together to identify areas of concern and exchange thoughts on heritage and culture in the Yukon . The conference aimed to initiate dialogue between the two main Yukon cultures so that everyone could " come into the light " together . The Adäka Cultural Festival has moved from an outdoor street location to the Kwanlin Dün Cultural Centre , ideally located beside the Yukon River in Whitehorse , Yukon . Since its launch in 2011 , Adäka has grown to include national and international artists coming from British Columbia , Alberta , Manitoba , Ontario , Quebec , Northwest Territories , Nunavut , United States , Greenland , and New Zealand .
