Anīrân ( Modern Persian , ) or Anērān ( Middle Persian , ) is an ethno - linguistic term that signifies " non - Iranian " or " non - Iran " ( non - Aryan ) . Thus , in a general sense , ' Aniran ' signifies lands where Iranian languages are not spoken . In a pejorative sense , it denotes " a political and religious enemy of Iran and Zoroastrianism . " The term ' Aniran ' derives from Middle Persian anērān , Pahlavi ʼnyrʼn , an antonym of ērān that in turn denoted either the people or the Sasanian Empire . However , " in Zoroastrian literature and possibly in Sasanian political thought as well , the term has also a markedly religious connotation . An anēr person is not merely non - Iranian , but specifically non - Zoroastrian ; and anēr designates also worshipers of the dēws ( " demons " ) or adherents of other religions . " In these texts of the ninth to twelfth century , " Arabs and Turks are called anēr , as are Muslims generally , the latter in a veiled manner . "
