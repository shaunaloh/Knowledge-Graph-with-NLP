Antonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek FRS (; ; 24 October 1632 – 26 August 1723 ) was a Dutch businessman and scientist in the Golden Age of Dutch science and technology . A largely self - taught man in science , he is commonly known as " the Father of Microbiology " , and one of the first microscopists and microbiologists . Van Leeuwenhoek is best known for his pioneering work in microscopy and for his contributions toward the establishment of microbiology as a scientific discipline . Raised in Delft , Dutch Republic , van Leeuwenhoek worked as a draper in his youth and founded his own shop in 1654 . He became well recognized in municipal politics and developed an interest in lensmaking . In the 1670s , he started to explore microbial life with his microscope . This was one of the notable achievements of the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery ( c. 1590s – 1720s ) . Using single - lensed microscopes of his own design , van Leeuwenhoek was the first to experiment with microbes , which he originally referred to as animalcules ( from Latin animalculum = " tiny animal " ) . Through his experiments , he was the first to relatively determine their size . Most of the " animalcules " are now referred to as unicellular organisms , although he observed multicellular organisms in pond water . He was also the first to document microscopic observations of muscle fibers , bacteria , spermatozoa , red blood cells , crystals in gouty tophi , and blood flow in capillaries . Although van Leeuwenhoek did not write any books , his discoveries came to light through correspondence with the Royal Society , which published his letters .
