Albert Tatlock is a fictional character on the British television soap opera Coronation Street . Albert was played by actor Jack Howarth from 1960 to 1984 . The character became something of an institution , so much so that grumpy old men were sometimes nicknamed " Albert Tatlock " . A veteran of the First World War , Albert settled back into civilian life by marrying and starting a family , however his wife Bessie died in 1959 and he retired from his job at the Town Hall the following year , taking up a new occupation as the street 's resident grumpy old man , forever complaining about the struggles of old age and living on the low income from his pension . Although Albert was never close to his daughter Beattie , he maintained close ties with his brother Alfred 's family , particularly his niece Valerie , who married Albert 's neighbour Ken Barlow in 1962 . With Val 's death in 1971 , and Beattie 's continued absence , Ken eventually moved into No.1 and took care of Albert in his twilight years until his death of a heart attack in May 1984 .
